# Spider-Bot :spider_web:

As its name defines it, our robot is a basic representation of the spider movements but it will not perform exactly the same body moves since we are using only four legs instead of eight legs.

Quadruped Robot – It is a four-legged walking robot which is a bionic replica of spider (Arachnid species) that uses their legs for movement and can perform some tasks either by human interaction or by its own.
